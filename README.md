Task Scheduler with MySQL and REST API

This project is a task scheduler built using MySQL for data storage and a REST API for communication. The backend allows for creating, updating, and deleting tasks, while providing scheduled task management functionality.

The front-end is implemented using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter, providing a simple graphical user interface for users to interact with the system. Users can add, modify, or view tasks with an intuitive UI, while the backend handles the scheduling and task persistence.
Features:

    Task management (create, update, delete, view tasks)
    REST API for communication between frontend and backend
    MySQL database for storing task information
    Simple GUI built with Python Tkinter for task interaction

Technologies Used:

    Python
    Tkinter (for frontend)
    MySQL (for task storage)
    Flask (for the REST API)

Setup:

    Clone the repository.
    Set up MySQL database and configure the connection.
    Install necessary Python dependencies (Flask, mysql-connector, Tkinter).
    Run the backend server.
    Launch the Tkinter frontend to manage tasks.

This project demonstrates task scheduling with full-stack development using Python, MySQL, and RESTful communication.
